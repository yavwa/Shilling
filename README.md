What is Shilling?

Shilling is a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to
be sent directly from one party to another globally without going through a financial institution.
A secure, decentralized, publicly managed banking ledger that will use Digital signatures to
provide the solution to prevent double-spending. 

Ambracing lyra2REv2 algorythm at block 200,000 from our usual Scrypt algorythm. Lyra2REv2 is memory intensive and it's a chained algorithm made up of several different existing hashing algorythms run in a certain order where the inputs to the latter hashes depend on the answers from the previous ones. Algorithms chosen also perform poorly on CPUs relative to GPUs which mitigates the effect of botnets of compromised devices and/or computers mining at no cost to the operator of the infected machines. It could contract and commit to forking in the event of an attack on the network.

Only 30,000,000 Digital Shillings will ever be mined. Shilling is a cryptocurrency made in Africa for Africa and embraces Kimoto Gravity Well on the Scrypt platform. With 6 mins between blocks, Shilling perfectly capitalizes on Africa's Computer power to mine at a block reward of 50 Shillings before halving which happens in 41.2 months since Genesis block.
